hei!

Amdalh's Lov:
Each thread sorts a partition of the array.
This part is done parallel.

while reading txt file, merging threads, and write to file are done
serial.

A sketch of totall time will be:

serial:         +     parallel:         +  serial:
read file             sort elements        merge threads
give partitions                            print to outfile
to threads


Run time:
Each thread uses quickSort algorithm. This has run time
O(nlogn) where n is totall elements.

Since sorting is done parallel. Run time of the parallel
part will be O(plogp) where p is totall elements of each 
partitions.
